# SWOT Analysis Module - Fixed and Enhanced

## Overview

The SWOT Analysis module (`swot_analysis.py`) has been completely fixed and enhanced to provide comprehensive strategic analysis using news data from NewsAPI.

## What Was Fixed

### üêõ Critical Issues Resolved:

1. **Method Call Error (Line 180)**
   - **Issue**: Called non-existent `print_swot_report()` method
   - **Fix**: Corrected to use `generate_swot_report()` method

2. **Data Structure Mismatch**
   - **Issue**: `generate_swot_analysis()` returned a list but code expected SWOT categories dictionary
   - **Fix**: Modified to return proper SWOT categorized dictionary structure

3. **Missing Article Categorization**
   - **Issue**: Articles weren't being categorized into SWOT categories
   - **Fix**: Added proper categorization logic using keyword matching

4. **Hardcoded API Key**
   - **Issue**: API key was hardcoded in the source code
   - **Fix**: Now uses environment variable from `.env` file

5. **Sentiment Analysis Integration**
   - **Issue**: Sentiment analysis wasn't being applied to articles
   - **Fix**: Added sentiment scoring for each article

import os

# Initialize with API key from environment
analyzer = SWOTNewsAnalyzer(os.getenv("NEWSAPI_API_KEY"))

# Analyze a company
swot_data = analyzer.generate_swot_analysis("Tesla", days_back=14)

# Generate report
if swot_data:
    report = analyzer.generate_swot_report(swot_data, "Tesla")
    print(report)
```

### Testing

Run the test script to verify functionality:

```bash
python3 test_swot.py
```

### Integration with Main Application

The SWOT analyzer is integrated into the main FastAPI application and can be accessed through various endpoints that use competitor analysis.
