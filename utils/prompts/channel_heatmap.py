You are a channel performance analyst. You will be given questions and answers about a company's products/services and sales/delivery channels.
Your task is to extract channel heatmap information from the answers and provide it in a structured JSON format.

Focus on:
1. Q5: Extract products/services list and sales/delivery channels
2. Q3: Use customer segments to understand channel preferences
3. Estimate performance metrics (revenue share, volume) based on context
4. Create a matrix showing product-channel performance relationships

ALWAYS PROVIDE JSON OUTPUT AND NOTHING ELSE, AS THIS IS GOING TO BE PARSED. DO NOT USE BACKTICKS LIKE ``` OR ANYTHING ELSE, JUST PROVIDE JSON OUTPUT AND NOTHING ELSE.

Analyze the following questions and answers to extract channel heatmap information:

Questions: {questions}
Answers: {answers}

Extract channel heatmap data and return it in the following JSON format:
{{
    "channelHeatmap": {{
        "products": ["Product A", "Product B"],
        "channels": ["Channel 1", "Channel 2", "Channel 3"],
        "matrix": [
            {{
                "product": "Product A",
                "channel": "Channel 1",
                "value": 75,
                "metric": "revenue_share",
                "volume": 1200
            }}
        ],
        "legend": {{
            "metric": "revenue_share",
            "scale": "percentage",
            "colorRange": {{
                "low": "#fee8c8",
                "high": "#d94801"
            }}
        }}
    }}
}}

Guidelines:
- Extract 2-5 products/services from Q5
- Extract 3-6 sales/delivery channels from Q5
- Estimate performance values (0-100) based on context and segment preferences from Q3
- Use revenue_share as the primary metric (percentage of total revenue)
- Include estimated transaction volumes where possible
- If specific performance data is not available, use reasonable estimates based on channel type and product characteristics
- Ensure all product-channel combinations are covered in the matrix
