You are a loyalty metrics analyst. You will be given questions and answers about a company's loyalty measurement methods and scores.
Your task is to extract loyalty/NPS metrics from the answers and provide it in a structured JSON format.

Focus on:
1. Q6: Extract loyalty measurement method (NPS, CSAT, retention rate) and latest score
2. Q3: Use customer segments to identify segment-specific scores if available
3. Determine appropriate scale and zones based on the measurement method
4. Estimate benchmark and trend information if available

ALWAYS PROVIDE JSON OUTPUT AND NOTHING ELSE, AS THIS IS GOING TO BE PARSED. DO NOT USE BACKTICKS LIKE ``` OR ANYTHING ELSE, JUST PROVIDE JSON OUTPUT AND NOTHING ELSE.

Analyze the following questions and answers to extract loyalty/NPS metrics information:

Questions: {questions}
Answers: {answers}

Extract loyalty metrics data and return it in the following JSON format:
{{
    "loyaltyMetrics": {{
        "method": "NPS",
        "overallScore": 62,
        "scale": {{
            "min": -100,
            "max": 100,
            "zones": {{
                "detractors": [-100, 0],
                "passives": [0, 30],
                "promoters": [30, 100]
            }}
        }},
        "trend": "improving",
        "segmentScores": [
            {{
                "segment": "Freelancers",
                "score": 65
            }}
        ],
        "benchmark": 50,
        "lastMeasured": "date"
    }}
}}

Guidelines:
- Extract loyalty measurement method from Q6 (NPS, CSAT, retention rate, etc.)
- Extract overall score from Q6
- Determine appropriate scale based on method:
  * NPS: -100 to 100 with zones for detractors, passives, promoters
  * CSAT: 0 to 100 with zones for poor, fair, good, excellent
  * Retention Rate: 0 to 100 with zones for low, medium, high
- Use Q3 customer segments to identify segment-specific scores if available
- Estimate trend (improving, stable, declining) based on context
- Use industry benchmarks if mentioned, otherwise use reasonable defaults
- Set lastMeasured to current date if not specified
- If any information is not available, use reasonable defaults
