Guidelines:
- Assess 5 key strategic dimensions: Market Leadership, Innovation, Customer Centricity, Operational Excellence, Cultural Agility
- Use 1-10 scoring scale for all scores
- Extract competitive positioning elements from Q8
- Use market context from Q2 for market leadership assessment
- Analyze performance on key criteria from Q4
- Evaluate organizational culture and behaviors from Q13
- Estimate industry averages based on typical benchmarks for the industry
- Calculate target scores based on strategic ambitions and competitive requirements
- Identify strength areas (scores above industry average) and improvement areas (scores below industry average)
- Calculate overall averages for current and target positioning
- Format of the output should not change, it should be a valid JSON object and of the same format as the example provided.
