Analyze the following questions and answers to create strategic goals and OKR analysis:

Questions: {questions}
Answers: {answers}

Create strategic goals analysis and return it in the following JSON format:
{{
    "strategicGoals": {{
        "year": "<year>",
        "objectives": [
            {{
                "objective": "<objective_description>",
                "priority": "<priority_number>",
                "keyResults": [
                    {{
                        "metric": "<metric_name>",
                        "target": "<target_value_or_date>",
                        "current": "<current_value_or_status>",
                        "progress": "<progress_percentage>"
                    }}
                ],
                "alignment": "<growth|innovation|retention|other>"
            }}
        ],
        "overallProgress": "<overall_progress_percentage>",
        "strategicThemes": [
            "<theme_1>",
            "<theme_2>",
            "<theme_3>"
        ]
    }}
}}

Guidelines:
- Extract strategic objectives from Q9 strategic goals and success metrics
- Identify key results for each objective with measurable targets
- Assign priority levels (1=highest, 2=medium, 3=lower)
- Determine strategic alignment themes (growth, innovation, retention, efficiency, etc.)
- Calculate progress percentages based on current vs target states
- Estimate overall progress as average of all objective progress
- Categorize strategic themes based on objective types
- Use Q2 market context to inform strategic priorities
- Format of the output should not change, it should be a valid JSON object and of the same format as the example provided.
