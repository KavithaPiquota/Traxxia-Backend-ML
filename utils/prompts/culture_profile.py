            "{{value_2}}",
            "{{value_3}}"
            # Add more values if needed (e.g., 'innovative', 'customer-focused')
        ],
        "behaviors": [
            "{{behavior_1}}",
            "{{behavior_2}}"
            # Add more behaviors if applicable (e.g., 'collaborative', 'risk-taking')
        ],
        "workStyle": {{
            "pace": "{{work_pace}}",  # e.g., 'fast', 'steady'
            "decisionMaking": "{{decision_style}}",  # e.g., 'autonomous', 'consensus-driven'
            "orientation": "{{work_orientation}}"  # e.g., 'results-driven', 'quality-focused'
        }},
        "employeeMetrics": {{
            "totalEmployees": "{{total_employees}}",  # Number of employees included in the culture context
            "costPercentage": "{{employee_cost_pct}}",  # % of total costs attributed to employees
            "valuePerEmployee": "{{value_per_employee}}",  # Output or revenue per employee
            "productivity": "{{productivity_level}}"  # Qualitative label like 'above_average', 'low', etc.
        }},
        "cultureType": "{{culture_type}}",  # e.g., 'Entrepreneurial', 'Hierarchical', 'Collaborative'
        "cultureFit": {{
            "withStrategy": "{{fit_with_strategy}}",  # Fit rating with strategy: 'high', 'medium', 'low'
            "withMarket": "{{fit_with_market}}",  # Fit rating with market: 'high', etc.
            "withCapabilities": "{{fit_with_capabilities}}"  # Fit rating with org capabilities: 'medium', etc.
        }}
    }}
}}




Guidelines:
- Extract cultural values and behaviors from Q13 culture description
- Analyze employee metrics from Q14 (headcount, costs, productivity)
- Determine work style characteristics (pace, decision-making, orientation)
- Classify culture type based on values and behaviors (Entrepreneurial, Bureaucratic, Clan, Market, etc.)
- Assess culture fit with strategy, market, and capabilities
- Calculate value per employee and productivity metrics
- Identify key cultural themes for word cloud visualization
- Format of the output should not change, it should be a valid JSON object and of the same format as the example provided.
